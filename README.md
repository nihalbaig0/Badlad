# Badlad Repo  

This repository contains the training and inference notebook, along with the presentation for **BUET CSE Fest DL Enigma 2.0**. The project focuses on solving the **Bangla Document Layout Analysis** problem using **LayoutLM**.  

---

## Overview  

### Problem Statement  
Bangla document layout analysis (Badlad) involves detecting and understanding structural components like headers, footers, paragraphs, tables, and images in Bangla documents. This project uses **LayoutLM**, a transformer-based model designed for document layout understanding, to tackle this challenge.  

### Competition  
- **Event**: BUET CSE Fest DL Enigma 2.0  
- **Task**: Bangla Document Layout Analysis

## Dataset  

The **Badlad** dataset was used for this project, which consists of annotated Bangla document images. Each document contains layout annotations for various structural elements, enabling comprehensive analysis.

## Repository Contents  

1. **Training Notebook**: A notebook for training the LayoutLM model on the Badlad dataset.  
2. **Inference Notebook**: A notebook to perform inference on new Bangla documents using the trained model.  
3. **Presentation**: Slides detailing the project, including methodology, results, and challenges.
